# ActiveDirectory
~~PowerShell Scripts, Functions, and Modules for managing Active Directory~~

I've forked very useful scripts from Mike Frobbins, so that in time I can develop a more capable AD Lockout PRTG sensor based on the AD Lockout script. (Crude beginning - as want to examine different objects based on a parameter - just proof of concept really, right now).

Obviously the script (PRTG sensor/probe etc.) would need read access / permission to the AD's Security Log/audit-thingy to work.
